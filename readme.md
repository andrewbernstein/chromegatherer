Chrome Gatherer
===============

Do you play Magic: The Gathering?
Do you use Google Chrome as a web browser?
Do you visit Gatherer pages but wish there was an easy way to just get the cards in a format that is easy to copy and paste in to a spreadsheet (Excel, Google Docs) for keeping track of your cards?

Now you're in luck!
Install the Chrome Plugin at (location tbd), go to a Gatherer page, switch to checklist mode, and click on the convenient G button to strip everything but the table with card info in it!

Potential To-Dos
================
- Undo button to revert changes (you can just refresh the page to undo)
- Update handy button to go to checklist mode if necessary
- Move code out of injecter.js in to script.js
- Add settings for removing columns
- Genericize it even further
- Change the button to something that isn't a poorly cropped G from Gatherer
- Change jquery to be remotely hosted
